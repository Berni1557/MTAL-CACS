## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>üìã  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Prediction

To predict the model in the paper, copy  all non-contrast enhanced cardiac CT (.mhd file format) into the data folder. To run the script, you can run the cacs.sh script or run the python script in the terminal directly.

```
python cacs_predict.py -m <path_to_pretrained_model> -d <path_to_data_folder> -p <path_to_prediction_folder> -gpu cuda
```

## Pre-trained Models

You can find the pretrained model in the model folder.

## Training

Since the training set and corresponding annottaions are not public, a training script is not provided.
